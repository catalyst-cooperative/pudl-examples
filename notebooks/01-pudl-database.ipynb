If you're already familiar with databases and SQL in Python, you can access them just like you would any other. [Support for SQLite](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) is built into the Python standard libraries, and the popular [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org) Python package also has extensive support for SQLite.  Here's one in-depth resource on using Python, SQLite and SQLAlchemy together: [Data Management with Python, SQLite, and SQLAlchemy](https://realpython.com/python-sqlite-sqlalchemy/)\n",

As a result, you'll often need to combine information from more than one table to make it readable or to get all the information you need for your analysis in one place. We've built some tools to do this automatically, which we'll get to below."

    "## Locate the PUDL DB file\n",
    "Each SQLite database is stored within a single file. To access the data, you need to know where that file is. With the location of the file, you can create an [SQLAlchemy connection engine](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/engines.html), which Pandas will use to read data out of the database. PUDL stores its data in a directory structure generally organized by file format. We store the paths to those directories and the SQLAlchemy database URLs in a Python dictionary that's usually called `pudl_settings`. Note that  a URL is just a path to a file that could be either local (on your computer) or remote (on someone else's computer). The following command will construct that `pudl_settings` dictionary based on some directory paths stored in the `.pudl.yml` file in your home directory. Printing out the dictionary contents you can see where PUDL will look for various resources."

So we wrote some code to do that work automatically and uniformly. We call this the PUDL Output Layer.

    "The PUDL database contains a tiny fraction of the data available in the original FERC Form 1 -- we have only taken the time to clean a handful of the FERC tables. The original FERC Form 1 data is often very messy and poorly organized. However, if you need to access one of the original 113 tables that we haven't integrated yet, they're all available, going back to 1994. The original tables are only accessible via direct queries (either using SQL or pulling whole tables) from the original FERC Form 1 database, so you'll have to use the `pandas.read_sql()` methods outlined above.\n",
