    "# Using the PUDL output layer\n",
    "The PUDL database tables are a clean, [normalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization) version of US electricity data. Normalized tables are great for databases and storage, but for interactive use, we often want a version of the data that includes plant and utility names and other associated info all in a single dataframe. These are \"denormalized\" tables. In addition to the referenced names and attributes like latitude and longitude or state, the denormalized tables often contain frequently calculated derived values (like calcuating `total_fuel_cost` from `total_heat_content_mmbtu` and `fuel_cost_per_mmbtu`). The Catalyst team developed a useful tool to access denormalized tables that we call the PUDL output object."

    "## What does the output layer provide?\n",
    "\n",
    "Right now the output layer provides access to three different kinds of things:\n",
    " * denormalized tables\n",
    " * analytical outputs\n",
    " * partially integrated PUDL datasets that aren't in the database yet"
   ]

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## Why is the output layer useful?\n",
    "Some benefits of using the output layer:\n",
    " * **Standardized denormalization:** You don't have to manually join the same tables together to get access to common attributes.\n",
    " * **Table caching:** many analyses rely on using the same table multiple times. The PUDL output object caches the tables in memory as pandas dataframes so you don't have to read tables from the database over and over again.\n",
    " * **Time series aggregation:** Some tables are annual, some monthly, some hourly. When you create a PUDL output object you can tell it to aggregate the data to either monthly or annual resolution for analysis.\n",
    " * **Standardized the filling-in of missing data:** There's a ton of missing or incomplete data. If requested, the output objects will use rolling averages and  data from the EIA API try to fill some of that missing data in.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Output layer caveats\n",
    "* Relying out this output layer means you need to install the whole PUDL python package and all of its dependencies.\n",
    "* Many of those dependencies are really only needed for producing the data, not using it.\n",
    "* If you want to use SQL directly, or R, or any other set of tools to work with the data, the output layer is not helpful.\n",
    "* In future releases we plan to load more of the derived data outputs directly into their own database tables for distribution.\n",
    "* We will also build denormalized tables that live inside the database as stored queries (database \"views\") so that all of this infrastructure is available to everyone, without needing to rely on the Python software environment."

    "The `generators_eia860` table is quite long, and the above cell probably took several seconds to read more than half a million records each with 100 columns, creating an 300MB Dataframe. If you run the same output routine again, it will complete almost instantly because that dataframe is already stored inside `pudl_out`. This is memory intensive, but can save time in calculations that need to use the same tables several times."
