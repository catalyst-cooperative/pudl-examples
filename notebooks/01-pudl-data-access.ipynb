Read EPA Hourly Emissions Data from Apache Parquet\n","* The full hourly emissions time series for thousands of US power plants covering 1995-2022 contains almost a billion records.\n","* The data is

tooling, including [Dask](https://www.dask.org/) and [PyArrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/index.html).\n","* Reading the entire dataset into memory at once will probably exceed the available

minimize the data read off of disk and limit memory usage.\n","* The Dask project has lots of [tutorials and documentation](https://www.dask.org/get-started) if you want to learn more.\n","* Other
