# PUDL Examples

This repository contains a collection of
[Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org) with examples of how to use the data
and software distributed under [Catalyst Cooperative](https://catalyst.coop)'s
[Public Utility Data Liberation (PUDL) project](https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl).

The example notebooks depend on having the processed PUDL data available. You can
download an archived data release and accompanying Docker image from Zenodo using the
following instructions

## Download and extract the archived data and Docker container

- Download and extract the most recent
  [PUDL data release from Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3653158)
  into a local directory. On MacOS and Windows you should just be able to
  double-click the archive file. On Linux (or MacOS) you may want to use the
  command line:

  ```sh
  tar -xzf filename.tgz
  ```

  It may take a couple of minutes to extract.

- Extracting the archive will create a directory containing the example Jupyter
  Notebooks from this repository, and all the processed PUDL data as a combination of
  [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org) databases and
  [Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) files.

## Install and run Docker

- [Download and install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). On MacOS
  and Windows it'll be called "Docker Desktop". On Linux it's just "Docker."
- On Linux, you'll need to separately install a tool called
  [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/cli-command/#install-on-linux)
  (it comes bundled with Docker Desktop for MacOS/Windows).
- If you're on MacOS or Windows, open the settings in Docker Desktop and
  increase the amount of memory that Docker is allowed to use to at least 8GB.
- Check to make sure that the Docker service is running in the background. On
  MacOS it should show up in the menu bar. On Windows it should show up in the
  system tray. On Linux, a daemon called `dockerd` should be running in the
  background.

## Load the archived Docker image

- At a command line, go into the directory which was created by extracting the
  archive. It should contain a file named `pudl-jupyter.tar` -- this is
  a Docker image which will run a Jupyter Notebook server for you locally, with
  all of the PUDL software installed and ready to use. But first you need to
  load the image into your local collection of docker images with this
  command:

  ```sh
  docker load -i pudl-jupyter.tar
  ```

  You should see some output at the command line as it loads the image.

## Start the Jupyter Notebook server using `docker compose`

- Once it's done loading, in that same directory (where you should also see a
  file named `docker-compose.yml`), run the command:

  ```sh
  docker compose up
  ```

- You should see some logging messages as the PUDL Docker image starts up and
  runs the Jupyter Notebook server. Near the end of those logging message, you
  should see several possible links to click or copy-and-paste.
  Pick one that starts with `https://localhost:48512` or
  `https://127.0.0.1:48512` and open it in a web browser. (Note: this is a local
  web address for the Jupyter Notebook server running on your computer.)
- You should see JupyterLab launcher and notebook interface. In the file
  browser in the left hand sidebar, you should see a `notebooks` directory with
  several example notebooks in it, which (hopefully!) you will be able to run.

## Add your own data

- If you have additional data you want to work with in conjunction with the
  PUDL data, you can put it in the `user_data` directory, and it will be
  accessible to you from within the Docker container. You can also save
  outputs to that directory inside the Docker container, and they will be
  available in the `user_data` directory on your computer.

# Addendum: Development-Oriented Usage

## Running the PUDL Jupyter Container with no data

If you just want the PUDL software environment without the processed data, for
development or other purposes, you can pull a Docker image from the
[catalystcoop/pudl-jupyter repository on DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/catalystcoop/pudl-jupyter) directly:

```sh
docker pull catalystcoop/pudl-jupyter:latest
```

This image is built automatically using
[`repo2docker`](https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker) whenever a commit
is made to the
[pudl-examples repository](https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl-examples)

## Environment Variables

The Docker container needs to be pointed at a couple of local directories to
work properly with PUDL. These paths are set using environment variables:

- `PUDL_DATA` is the path to the PUDL directory containing your PUDL
  `data`, `sqlite` and `epacems` directories. It is treated as read-only, and by
  default is set to `./pudl_data`
- `USER_DATA` is a local directory that you want to have access to
  within the container. It can contain other data, or your own notebooks, etc. by
  default it is set to `./user_data`

You can change these defaults by editing the `.env` file in the top directory of
this repository (or the archive you downloaded from Zenodo)

To be able to fill in data using the EIA API, you'll need to [obtain an API KEY
from EPA](https://www.eia.gov/opendata/register.php). If you set an environment
variable called `API_KEY_EIA` in the shell where you run the
`catalystcoop/pudl-jupyter` container using `docker compose` then the value of
that environment variable will be passed in to the container and available for
use automatically.
