    "# FERC Electric Quarterly Report (EQR) Access Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "The Electric Quarterly Report (EQR) is submitted by sellers participating in bilateral electricity market transactions. The reports summarize the contractual terms and conditions in agreements for all jurisdictional services, including cost-based sales, market-based rate sales, and transmission service, as well as transaction information for short-term and long-term market-based power sales and cost-based power sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've made an initial version of the EQR dataset available in PUDL. We also apply some [basic cleaning](https://catalystcoop-pudl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data_sources/ferceqr.html#pudl-data-transformations) to the raw data, though we know there is a lot more to be done - please [reach out](https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl/issues/new?template=data_bug_report.yml) if you discover any irregularities within the data!\n",
    "\n",
    "EQR data is comprised of the following 4 tables, which cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `core_ferceqr__contracts`: contracts between companies participating in the power market\n",
    "- `core_ferceqr__quarterly_identity`: information about report filers\n",
    "- `core_ferceqr__quarterly_index_pub`: information about price indices\n",
    "- `core_ferceqr__transactions`: individual transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "For table and column level metadata see our [docs](https://catalystcoop-pudl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data_sources/ferceqr.html#ferc-form-920-electric-quarterly-report-eqr).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with EQR\n",
    "\n",
    "The main challenge of working with EQR is the size of the `core_ferceqr__transactions` table, which is >83GB in total. The other tables are all small enough that they can be loaded with a call to `pandas.read_parquet()` - which we will demonstrate.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will go over how to access EQR data, and how to use `duckdb` and `pandas` together to work with the large transactions table."
